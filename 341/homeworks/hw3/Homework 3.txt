A) 1. O(n log n)   
2. The while loop has a O(log n) time because the number is being halved and the for loop at the bottom has a running time of n. Multiplied together to get n log n.
3. Omega(log n)
4. Since for loops have a constant lower bound, doThis has Omega(log n) making the answer Omega(log n)
B) 1. O(n)   
2.  The loop is run twice, and is bounded by n. It only takes that plus the constant time it takes to assign a variable. So for a number n, it is bounded by O(n).
3. Omega(1)
4. The lower bound of the for loop is constant time.
C) 1. O(n^2)
2. The while loop is nested by a for loop with a bound of n. Since the while loop is bounded by n as well, the O is n^2.
3. Omega(n/2)
4. The for loop will have a constant lower bound, so the while loop will be responsible for the Omega(n/2)
D) 1. O(n)
2. The for loop is bounded by n, and since the while loop is not nested, you simply add its    O(log n) to n. Since n is greater, the answer is O(n log n)
3. Omega(log(n))
4. A for loop has a lower bound of constant time, and since the lower bound of log(n) is a closer bound, it is Omega(log(n)).
E) 1. O(n^2)   
2. Since sum = the sum of I's which is n = k(k+1)/2 thus the O is n^2.
3. Omega(n^2)
4. Using the same logic, n = k(k+1)/2 making the lower bound the same, Omega of n^2.
