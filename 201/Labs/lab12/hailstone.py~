# Description:
#   This file contains python code that implements the
#   "flight" of a hailstone, following the HOTPO rules
#   (also known as the Collatz Conjecture), recursively
# Collaboration: During lab, collaboration between students is allowed,
#                although I understand I still must understand the material
#                and complete the assignment myself. 

# NO CONSTANTS NEEDED, THE NUMBERS USED IN flight() ARE
#    PART OF A FORMULA/MATHEMATICAL CONJECTURE


# flight() recursively calculates the path of a hailstone
# Input:   the height of the hailstone
# Output:  a recursive call, which at the end returns the number of "steps" 
#          taken for the hailstone to reach a height of 1
def flight(height,steps):

    #### base case(s)
    # print out an "invalid" message and return 0
    if height<1:
        print("Invalid height of",height)
        return 0,steps
    # stops when it reachs height of 1 (the ground)
    elif height==1:
        print("Height of",height)
        return 1,steps
    #### recursive case(s)
    # if the current height is even, divide it by 2
    elif (height%2)==0:
        steps+=1
        print("Height of",height)
        return flight(height/2,steps)
    # if the current height is odd, multiply it by 3, then add 1
    else:
        steps+=1
        print("Height of",height)
        return flight((height*3)+1,steps)

def main():

    print("Welcome to the Hailstone Simulator!")
    startHeight = int(input("Please enter a height for the hailstone to start at: "))
    steps = 0
    # initial recursive call goes here
    height,steps = flight(startHeight,steps)
    print("\nIt took", steps, "steps to hit the ground.")

    print("Thank you for using the Hailstone Simulator!\n")
