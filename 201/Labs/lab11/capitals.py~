# Description:
#   This file contains python code that reads in a list of
#   states and their capitals, stores it in a dictionary,
#   and then allows the user to list all options (states),
#   or to show the capital of a specified state.
# Collaboration: During lab, collaboration between students is allowed,
#                although I understand I still must understand the material
#                and complete the assignment myself.
